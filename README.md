## 👋 Hi there, I'm a frontend engineer passionate about making the internet accessible to everyone. I specialize in building web applications with Next.js, React.js, and Redux Toolkit. To create beautiful and responsive designs, I use SCSS, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, and Material UI. For my backend, I rely on Prisma to manage my database and API layer.

## 🚀 As a web performance consultant, I help companies optimize their web products for speed and efficiency. I believe that the internet should be fast and accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or device. I work closely with my clients to create high-performance web applications that deliver a seamless user experience.

## 🤝 I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you're interested in working together or have any questions, feel free to reach out!
